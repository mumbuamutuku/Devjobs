## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Be able to filter jobs on the index page by title, location, and whether a job is for a full-time position
- Be able to click a job from the index page so that they can read more information and apply for the job

## Our process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
- Local Storage- For making storing the theme.
- Flask - Python Library for the backend


### What we learned

- Web Development: We learnt how to structure web pages, create responsive layouts, and enhance user experiences through interactivity.
- API Design: Designing and implementing APIs for this job board application taught us how to define endpoints, handle request/response formats (e.g., JSON), and structure data for efficient communication between client and server.
- Database Management: We also learnt how to design database schemas, create tables, define relationships between entities, and write queries to retrieve job postings and user information.
Frontend Frameworks: Using frontend frameworks like Vue.js helps enhance the user interface and build interactive components. We  learnt how to manage state, handle events, fetch data asynchronously, and create reusable UI elements.


### Challenges Encountered

- User Interface Design: Getting the user Interface to look exactly like the one we had was challenging and took a whole lot of time.
- Database Design and Scalability: consideration on how to store and retrieve large amounts of job listings, user profiles, resumes, and other relevant data efficiently. Additionally, ensuring data security, optimizing query performance, and planning for future scalability are essential.
- Job Matching and Recommendation: Implementing an effective job matching algorithm is critical to connect job seekers with suitable opportunities. Developing algorithms that take into account factors like skills, experience, location, preferences, and other relevant criteria can be complex.


### Continued development

- Integrate frontend with the backend:
    - Connect the frontend components to the backend API endpoints.
    - Implement data binding and event handling between Vue components and Flask views.
    - Ensure seamless communication between the frontend and backend for data retrieval and submission.
